# Dice-Simulator
This is a QT(C++) GUI application that simulates a dice that is rolled 6 times. 

The program uses a Momento design pattern to save the states, i.e. to save the previous rolls of the dice. 

The user is allowed to view the previous roll sequences (6 rolls). The rolls is saved in a list widget and when the user clicks on a roll sequence, the application will display the outcomes.
